# c-sharp-calculator-app

## This is my first project, a calculator app, using and learning C# syntax. With this, I am also learning how to use Microsoft Visual Studio.


### Arrays.

```
            int[] luckyNumbers = { 4, 8, 15, 48, 32 };

            string[] friends = new string[3];

            friends[0] = "Matt";
            friends[1] = "Frances";

            luckyNumbers[0] = 7;

            Console.WriteLine(luckyNumbers[0]);

            Console.ReadLine();

```
